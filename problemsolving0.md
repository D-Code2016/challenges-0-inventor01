#Problem Solving

Developers are puzzle constructors. Only, the pieces are code. Problem solving is a very important skills for a developer. Businesses have problems that they think software can solve, and it's up to the development team to build out the solutions they desire. The team consists of more than just programmers, but also designers, project managers and quality assurance. The entire team works together to solve the problems business presents. Yet, for programmers understanding how to use logical steps to solve problems is vital. This is because computers are simple creatures. They need instructions to be step by step. You can't simply type "create a web page" and wah-lah! You have to build it out element by element and then tell the computer how it should look element by element and then tell the computer how to display it!
